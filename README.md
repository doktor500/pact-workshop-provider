### Requirements

- Ruby 2.4.4 (It is already installed if you are using Mac OS X)
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

### Setup the environment

Install bundler 1.17.2 if you don't have it already installed

`sudo gem install bundler -v 1.17.2`

Verify that you have the right version by running `bundler --version`

If you have a more up to date versions of bundler, unistall them with `gem uninstall bundler` until the most up to date and default version of bundler is 1.17.2

### Install dependencies

- Execute `bundle install`

### Run the tests

- Execute `rspec`

### Provider Step 0 (Setup)

Get familiraised with the code

![System diagram](https://github.com/doktor500/pact-workshop-provider/blob/master/resources/system-diagram.png "System diagram")

There are two microservices in this system. A `consumer` and a `provider` (this repository).

The "provider" is a PaymentService that validates if a credit card number is valid in the context of that system.

The "consumer" only makes requests to PaymentService to verify payment methods.

Checkout the [Consumer](https://github.com/doktor500/pact-workshop-consumer/) microservice, if you haven't already done so, so the directory structure looks like:

    drwxr-xr-x - pact-workshop-consumer
    drwxr-xr-x - pact-workshop-provider

Follow the instructions in the **Consumer's** readme file

### Provider Step 1 (Verifing an existing contract)

When we previously ran (in the consumer) the `spec/payment_service_client_spec.rb` test, it passed, but it also generated a `spec/pacts/paymentserviceclient-paymentservice.json` pact file that we can use to validate our assumptions on the provider side.

Pact has a rake task to verify the provider against the generated pact file. It can get the pact file from any URL (like the last successful CI build), but we are just going to use the local one.

Add to the `Rakefile` file the following line `require 'pact/tasks'` so it looks like this:

```ruby
require 'bundler'

begin
  Bundler.setup(:default, :development)
rescue Bundler::BundlerError => e
  $stderr.puts e.message
  $stderr.puts "Run `bundle install` to install missing gems"
  exit e.status_code
end

require 'rake'
require 'rspec/core/rake_task'
require 'pact/tasks'

RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec)

task :default => [:spec]
```

Create `spec/pact_helper.rb` file with the following content

```ruby
require 'pact/provider/rspec'

Pact.service_provider "PaymentService" do
  honours_pact_with 'PaymentServiceClient' do
    pact_uri '../pact-workshop-consumer/spec/pacts/paymentserviceclient-paymentservice.json'
  end
end
```

In the `pact-workshop-provider` directory run `rake pact:verify`. You should see a failure because the consumer test does not validate the provider's current implementation.

Change the consumer test in the `pact-workshop-consumer` repository, so it references payment method `status` instead of payment method `state`. Generate the pact json file again by running `rspec`, and in the `pact-workshop-provider` repository execute the rake task `rake pact:verify` until the contract test becomes green.

When the test is fixed, in the `pact-workshop-consumer` directory run `git clean -df && git checkout . && git checkout consumer-step2`, also in the `pact-workshop-provider` directory run `git clean -df && git checkout . && git checkout provider-step2` and follow the instructions in the **Consumer's** readme file
